# dee-site

A playground for web projects. Main goal is to transition my website from a static html(pug)/css(sass) site to a web app. Ehh, found out about Gatsby and stopped that other thing

Tools:

-   Gatsby (all the plugins!)
-   sass (scss)
-   Emotion.js

Roadmap

-   integrate a js framework (vue, react) - Using React and Gatsby for Static Site Generation
-   add an animation library
-   link other microsites to this one (repo) with Netlify proxying
