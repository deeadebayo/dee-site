# dee-site

My attempt at building a personal site using Jamstack principles. Main goal was to transition my website from a static html(pug)/css(sass) site to a web app then I found out about Gatsby and learned React.

Highlights:

- Gatsby (w/ plugins - check my gatsby-config file )
- Emotion.js for CSS-in-JS styling (more complex styling done in SASS)
- Framer Motion for native looking animations
- CI/CD pipeline (usually from the 'main' branch) with hosting on Netlify

Roadmap

- ~~integrate a js framework (vue, react) - Using React and Gatsby for Static Site Generation~~
- ~~add an animation library~~ Framer-Motion
- Decouple data from this repo (maybe host on Contentful or Airtable)
- link other microsites/projects to this site with Netlify proxying -or- try out a monorepo?
